# Introduction

## Implementation

## Execution

1. To initialize hashicorp in project, use command:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. This command will allow you to check whether initialization is done properly and will give you a overview to you about your **infrastructure** going to be deployed in AWS.

```bash
terraform plan
```

3. This command will allow you to push or create your infrastructure in AWS using Terraform by Hashicorp.

```bash
terraform apply 
```

4. After you created your infrastructure, you either have two choices whether to keep the infrastructure being deployed on AWS or you can delete all of your infrastructure in AWS.

```bash
terraform destroy
```
